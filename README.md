# OVERTIME APP



The audit logs were necessary because they represent all of the potential records. The posts were only for the overtime requests. you can look at the difference like this:

 - posts are only for overtime requests.

- audit logs are for overtime requests and for confirming that no overtime was requested on a specific day.

We created 100 posts to have sample data to view in the browser, it's just sample data.

The audit logs were originally a special request from the client and would be the records shown to the government if they were asked for a full log of if an employee worked overtime hours or if they confirmed that they didn't.
